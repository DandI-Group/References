We collect and maintain a list of software packages and references that are useful for our work,
and coordinate other activities including socializing and outreach.

We also archive presentations and papers, and possibly code (in the future).
When you upload a presentation or poster or paper,
please start the file name with the year, main author, then title.
For example: 2016_HartyEtAl_ImprovingSatelliteDerivedIrradianceEstimates.pdf
